			can set this priority level.
	A - Highly crucial task that opens up other tasks to be done, should not
			be put off.
	B - Important task that opens up other tasks, represents less time
			investement than class A tasks, can be put off.
	C - Adds a crucial feature that _may_ open up a few other tasks.
	D - Adds a convenient feature that is not necessary to development.
	E - Cleanup tasks that are done last.
